# Exercise 2: Write a program that uses input to prompt a user for their name and then welcomes them.

name = input('Please, insert your name: ')
print('Welcome, {}!'.format(name))

# Exercise 3: Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour to compute gross pay.

hours = input('How many hours did you work? ')
rate = input('How much is the rate of your job? ')

gross_pay = float(hours) * float(rate)

print('Your total payment is $ {:.2f}.'.format(gross_pay))

# Exercise 4: Assume that we execute the following assignment statements:

# width = 17
# height = 12.0
# For each of the following expressions, write the value of the expression and the type 
# (of the value of the expression).
# 1. width//2
# 2. width/2.0
# 3. height/3
# 4. 1 + 2 * 5

width = 17
height = 12.0

print(width//2)     # It will be 8 - a Integer
print(width/2.0)    # It will be 8.5 - a Float
print(height/3)     # It will be 4.0 - a Float
print(1 + 2 * 5)    # It will be 11 - a Integer

# Exercise 5: Write a program which prompts the user for a Celsius temperature, 
# convert the temperature to Fahrenheit, and print out the converted temperature.

temp = float(input('Please, insert the desired temperature in Celsius to be converted in Fahreinheit: '))
temp_fahr = 32.0 + (temp * (9/5))

print('The temperature of {:.1f}ºC is {:.1f}ºF'.format(temp, temp_fahr))
